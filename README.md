## **Planning stage**

### **Target Audiences:**

- Users looking to buy a luxury car.
- Users that want to sell their own luxury cars.
- Users that want to be able to easily access the website from their mobile device as well as their other devices.

### **User Stories:**

- As a user I want to see the subject matter of the page.
- As a new user I want to be able to view the site without logging in.
- As a user I want to be able to create, read, update and delete a listing of my own car.
- As a luxury car enthusiast, I want to be able to view the fleet of high end cars available in this showroom.
- As a mobile user, I want the website to be responsive and all the sections of the website to be easily accessible and functional on my smartphone or tablet, ensuring a seamless experience regardless of the device I'm using.

### **Site Aims:**

- To inform the user what the website is about.
- To insure the user that the website is fluid and can be navigated at ease every step of their experience.

- To allow the user to be able to contact the showroom without any trouble.

### **How Will This Be Achieved:**

- The landing page of the website provides the user a short description of what he can find in the showroom. The user can also read more about the website in the About section.
- The site provides information about the fleet of cars it has in stock and details of each car.
- The site provides the user a form to register and login, so that they can sell their private luxury car.
- The users are able to create their own listing and it will be displayed in their account, where they can update their listing or delete it whenever they decide.
- The users are able to contact the showroom through a form where they can send a message or if they prefer, there is a email adress displayed as well as a phone number.

### **Color Scheme:**

When deciding the color scheme I wanted a dark road background with grey or white text for the contents for a good contrast. The color palette was created using [https://coolors.co/]
![Color Palette](https://github.com/RazvanTr10/Sophisticated-Wheels/blob/main/static/images/documentation/palette.png?raw=true)


I also created this color contrast grid using [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23191919%0D%0A%233C4146%0D%0A%236B6464%0D%0A%23ACA0A0%0D%0A%23FCFAFA&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp), to check the contrast scored and ensure the text remains visible across the entire website and that the site is accessible to everyone.
